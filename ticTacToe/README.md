# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Learning From : (Here)[https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe]

Status : `Abandonded`

Reason : I started this project about 3 days ago and I lost motivation to continue it. I believe that I am just wasting my time by continuing this project. At this point of time, I believe that it would be much more efficient to learn react by making my protfolio website. I want to finish making the portfolio website quickly and move onto making an ai web app. 
The ai web app will use react for frontend. It will use ovpenCv to rechonize handwriting convert it into maths equations and solve it.
